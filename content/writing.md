# Writing

Right now, most of my writing lives in my case studies. They’re written as decision narratives: context → frame → tradeoffs → outcome.

- [Decision systems case studies](/case-studies/)
- RSS feed: [Case studies RSS](/case-studies/index.xml)

If you’re looking for something specific, start with:

- [Preventing Metric Theater in Drug Discovery ML](/case-studies/preventing-metric-theater-drug-discovery-ml/)
- [Reducing Pipeline Latency to Enable Real-Time Decision Loops](/case-studies/reducing-pipeline-latency-decision-velocity/)
