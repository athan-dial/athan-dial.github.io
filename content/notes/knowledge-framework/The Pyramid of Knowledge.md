A concept, from early information theory (?) that asserts information is synthesized via four distinct layers:

1. **Data**: The raw input that our senses and instruments detect.
2. **Information**: Data that has been processed and interpreted.
3. **Knowledge**: Information that has been organized and understood in a meaningful way.
4. **Wisdom**: The highest level, where knowledge is applied effectively in decision-making.
