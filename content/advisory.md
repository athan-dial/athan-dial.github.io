# Let's Talk

I occasionally advise teams working on decision systems, evaluation frameworks, and analytics strategy. I enjoy conversations about turning ambiguous, high-stakes problems into decision frameworks that teams can actually use.

My background: research-grade evaluation rigor (PhD in multi-omics analysis) + product judgment (drug discovery ML). I design frameworks from first principles, not templates.

---

## Topics I Think About

### Designing Decision Frameworks
- How to structure decision contexts for ambiguous problems
- Building north star + guardrails that actually guide prioritization
- Stakeholder alignment when definitions of "good" conflict

### Evaluation Systems for ML & Data Products
- Offline validation + online monitoring architectures
- Preventing "metric theater" in model evaluation
- What counts as evidence when ground truth is delayed or absent

### Analytics Strategy & Capability Building
- Moving from ad-hoc analyses to repeatable decision systems
- Aligning analytics with business OKRs
- Building analytics functions that accelerate decision velocity

### Technical Architecture for Data Systems
- Tradeoff analysis for build vs. buy decisions
- Data pipeline optimization for cost, latency, reliability
- Monitoring and observability for production systems

## How I Approach These Conversations

I focus on understanding your decision context first—what's uncertain, what's constrained, what counts as "good enough." Then I work through options analysis and tradeoff documentation to make decisions defensible to stakeholders.

I don't deliver generic best practices. Every framework is designed from first principles for your specific constraints.
