## Overview

These case studies demonstrate product judgment, technical depth, and execution leadership from my tenure at Montai, a drug discovery AI startup. Each follows the format: Context → Ownership → Decision Frame → Outcome → Reflection.

**Focus:** Decision systems, not achievements. What options existed, what I chose, why, and what I learned.

## Featured Case Studies

### [Scaling AI-Driven Drug Nominations]({{< ref "scaling-ai-nominations-montai" >}})
**Product Strategy + Technical Architecture** | 2023-2024

Scaled compound nominations 26× (250 → 6,500+ per program) while improving hit-to-lead rates from 5% to 27%. Built end-to-end data pipeline automating ML predictions, designed phased rollout strategy balancing speed and quality.

**Key decisions:** Phased scaling (prove → scale → refine) vs immediate optimization, quality gates to prevent stakeholder trust erosion, balancing exploration and exploitation.

---

### [From Data Crisis to Data Culture]({{< ref "stat6-data-crisis-response-montai" >}})
**Execution Leadership + Incident Response** | 2025

Led response to critical data integrity failure (STAT6 predictions missing, 6-week program delay). Established postmortem process and data governance framework preventing recurrence (3 incidents in 2024 → 0 in 2026).

**Key decisions:** Targeted fix + governance uplift vs quick patch or comprehensive rebuild, blameless postmortem culture, proactive monitoring investment post-crisis.

---

### [Learning Agendas: Research Rigor for Product Decisions]({{< ref "learning-agenda-framework-montai" >}})
**Product Strategy + PhD Transfer** | 2025

Designed decision framework reducing R&D cycle time 20% (~10 weeks → ~8 weeks) by pre-defining success criteria and pivot triggers. Applied academic experimental design to product/strategy decisions.

**Key decisions:** Lightweight one-page format vs heavyweight docs, enforcing pre-commitment to decision criteria, balancing rigor and pragmatism for scientist adoption.

---

### [Build vs Buy: Strategic Analysis for Analog Generation]({{< ref "xtalpi-build-vs-buy-analysis-montai" >}})
**Strategic Analysis + Executive Communication** | Q4 2025

Quantitative analysis guiding $250k+ partnership decision: XtalPi external compounds vs improving internal generative model. ROI modeling revealed internal model needed 50× accuracy improvement; recommended hybrid approach (external for near-term + internal investment for long-term).

**Key decisions:** Build vs buy rarely binary (hybrid optimal), quantitative framing transforms opinions into evidence, strategic patience requires near-term wins.

---

### [Standardizing Montai's App Ecosystem with R Shiny]({{< ref "shiny-framework-standardization-montai" >}})
**Technical Architecture + Developer Experience** | 2024

Converged fragmented app development (Python/Streamlit/Dash + R/Shiny + notebooks) onto single framework, cutting development time 66% (3 weeks → 1 week). Built proof-of-concept Nomination App and reusable component library.

**Key decisions:** R Shiny (team skills + data-heavy use case) vs Python frameworks vs multi-framework flexibility, trading long-term flexibility for near-term velocity, standardization as social + technical choice.

---

## Additional Case Studies

### [Preventing Metric Theater in Drug Discovery ML]({{< ref "preventing-metric-theater-drug-discovery-ml" >}})
**Product Strategy + Evaluation Frameworks** | 2024

Designed combined offline + online evaluation framework de-risking $2M+ compound decisions by catching model degradation 3 months earlier. Established monitoring infrastructure reused by 3+ model teams.

---

### [Reducing Pipeline Latency for Decision Velocity]({{< ref "reducing-pipeline-latency-decision-velocity" >}})
**Technical Architecture + Data Engineering** | 2023-2024

Automated data pipeline reducing latency from 2-3 days to same-day updates. Enabled real-time analytics dashboards used for investor updates and program decisions.

## Themes Across Case Studies

**Decision Systems Over One-Off Analyses**
- Learning Agenda framework (reusable structure, not one project)
- Build vs Buy quantitative analysis (template for future decisions)
- Data Quality governance (postmortem process, not one incident fix)

**Product Judgment + Technical Depth**
- Strategic analysis (XtalPi ROI modeling) + technical execution (Shiny framework)
- Quality gates (nomination filtering) + pipeline automation (dbt implementation)
- PhD rigor (experimental design) + startup pragmatism (lightweight formats)

**Candid Reflection on Tradeoffs**
- Phased scaling delays (perfect vs done tension)
- Framework lock-in risks (Shiny standardization)
- Crisis response delays (monitoring investment should've been proactive)
