# Athan Dial, PhD

**PhD-trained in multi-omics analysis. Product-tested in drug discovery ML.**

**Decision evidence, not achievements.** I combine product judgment with technical depth to turn ambiguous problems into decision systems. I communicate in decisions, metrics, and outcomes—not activity. I build repeatable systems, not one-off analyses.

## How I Can Help

**For Hiring Teams**: Looking for a data science or product leader who can transform ambiguous problems into shipped outcomes? Start with my [decision portfolio](/resume/) to see how I approach high-stakes decisions.

**For Teams & Leaders**: Interested in discussing decision systems, evaluation frameworks, or analytics strategy? I occasionally advise teams working on these topics. [Let's talk](/advisory/)

**For Peers & Community**: Want to learn about decision systems, evaluation frameworks, or the PhD → product transition? Read my [decision systems case studies](/case-studies/) and [writing](/writing/) to see my thinking process.
