  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Start local server:**
```bash
cd /Users/adial/Documents/GitHub/athan-dial.github.io
hugo server -D
```

**Content verification (http://localhost:1313):**
1. Read biography in header area - does it convey decision-making philosophy?
2. Scroll to Skills section - are 4 categories visible with appropriate skills?
3. Scroll to Experience section - is PhD listed as experience (not just education)?
4. Read experience summaries - do they follow narrative paragraph format?
5. Scroll to Education section - are degrees listed?
6. Click LinkedIn and GitHub links - do they work?

**Visual design verification:**
7. Is the accent color executive blue (not orange)?
8. Does the overall aesthetic feel minimal and elegant?
9. Is typography clean and readable?

**Dark mode verification:**
10. Click the toggle button (top-right corner)
11. Does the theme switch smoothly?
12. Is text readable in dark mode?
13. Refresh the page - does it stay in dark mode?

**Mobile verification (optional but recommended):**
14. Open DevTools (Cmd+Option+I) → toggle device toolbar
15. Select iPhone viewport
16. Do sections stack properly?
17. Is toggle button accessible?
