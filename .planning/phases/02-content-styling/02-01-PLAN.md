<objective>
Populate professional profile with complete work history, skills inventory, education credentials, biography, and contact information using Hugo Resume theme's JSON data file architecture.

Purpose: Deliver the "decision portfolio" content that demonstrates PhD-to-Product leader positioning through structured narrative summaries and domain-based skill organization.

Output: Five populated data files and updated config that render a complete single-page resume.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create JSON Data Files for Experience, Skills, and Education</name>
  <files>
    data/experience.json
    data/skills.json
    data/education.json
  </files>
  <action>
Create `data/` directory and populate three JSON data files following Hugo Resume schema.

**experience.json:**
- Array of role objects with: role, company, summary, range
- Use paragraph summaries (2-3 sentences per role, NOT bullet lists)
- Structure each summary as: scope/responsibility → key outcomes with metrics → approach or secondary impact
- List PhD as an experience entry (NOT just education) showing explicit skills transfer to product leadership
- Include full career arc from PhD research through current Director of Product role
- Use placeholder company names ([Company Name], [University Name]) since authentic content not available yet
- Placeholder metrics acceptable (40% improvement, 6 weeks → 2 weeks) - will be refined with real data later

Example entry structure:
```json
{
  "role": "Director of Product",
  "company": "[Company Name]",
  "summary": "Led cross-functional team of 12 engineers and data scientists building ML-powered platform. Increased decision velocity 40% through learning agenda framework while reducing pipeline latency from 6 weeks to 2 weeks. Managed $5M annual budget across 3 product lines.",
  "range": "January 2023 - Present"
}
```

**skills.json:**
- Array of grouping objects with: grouping (category name), skills (array of strings or objects)
- Four domain categories per CONTEXT.md: Product Leadership, Data Science & ML, Technical Leadership, Tools
- Use icon metadata for core competencies (optional, Claude's discretion on exact icons)
- Balance product/leadership skills equally with technical skills
- Skills can be strings (simple) or objects with name/icon/link (enhanced)

Example structure:
```json
[
  {
    "grouping": "Product Leadership",
    "skills": ["Learning Agenda Design", "Roadmap Strategy", "Cross-functional Leadership"]
  }
]
```

**education.json:**
- Array of degree objects with: school, degree, major, notes (optional), range
- PhD entry should have brief notes field showing skills transfer (complements the experience.json PhD entry)
- School field can include markdown links: "[University Name](https://university.edu)"

Validate JSON syntax with proper array/object structure before committing.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `ls data/` shows experience.json, skills.json, education.json
- `cat data/experience.json | python3 -m json.tool` validates JSON syntax
- `cat data/skills.json | python3 -m json.tool` validates JSON syntax
- `cat data/education.json | python3 -m json.tool` validates JSON syntax
- `hugo server` starts without JSON parsing errors
  </verify>
  <done>
Three JSON data files exist with valid syntax, PhD appears in experience timeline, skills organized into 4 domain categories.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update Biography and Contact Configuration</name>
  <files>
    content/_index.md
    config/_default/params.toml
  </files>
  <action>
**content/_index.md:**
Update biography to match positioning voice from CONTEXT.md:
- First person ("I build..." not "Athan builds...")
- Lead with decision-making philosophy, credentials support it
- Professional but warm tone
- Short: 2-3 sentences max
- Punchy intro - details live in experience section

Example (adapt to natural voice):
```markdown
---
title: "Athan Dial"
---

I build product systems that turn uncertainty into velocity. With a PhD in computational biology and experience leading ML product teams, I bridge technical depth with strategic product thinking. I specialize in decision frameworks that help teams move faster without moving recklessly.
```

**config/_default/params.toml:**
- Ensure contact info is complete (email = "contact via LinkedIn" per current config)
- Add sections array to control section ordering: skills → experience → education
- Verify social handles include LinkedIn and GitHub with correct URLs
- Set showQr = false, showContact = true (already correct)

Add sections parameter if missing:
```toml
# Section ordering (top to bottom on page)
sections = ["skills", "experience", "education"]
```
  </action>
  <verify>
- `hugo server` starts and renders updated biography on homepage
- Biography displays in first person with decision-making philosophy emphasis
- Social links in footer/header link to correct LinkedIn and GitHub profiles
- Section order shows skills first, then experience, then education
  </verify>
  <done>
Biography displays decision-making philosophy in first person, social links work, sections render in skills → experience → education order.
  </done>
</task>

Run these checks after both tasks complete:

1. **Content rendering:**
   ```bash
   hugo server -D
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:1313 and verify:
   - Biography appears in header/intro area
   - Experience section shows all roles including PhD
   - Skills section shows 4 category groupings
   - Education section shows degrees

2. **JSON validation:**
   ```bash
   for f in data/*.json; do echo "Validating $f"; cat "$f" | python3 -m json.tool > /dev/null && echo "Valid" || echo "INVALID"; done
   ```

3. **Links functional:**
   - Click LinkedIn link → opens linkedin.com/in/athandial/
   - Click GitHub link → opens github.com/athan-dial

4. **Section ordering:**
   - Skills section appears before Experience
   - Experience section appears before Education
