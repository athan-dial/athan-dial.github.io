<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Configure layout components with Explorer filtering and footer links</name>
  <files>/Users/adial/Documents/GitHub/quartz/quartz.layout.ts</files>
  <action>
Edit quartz.layout.ts to:

1. Update footer links from Quartz defaults to:
   - "Portfolio": "https://athan-dial.github.io/"
   - "GitHub": "https://github.com/athan-dial"

2. Configure Explorer in defaultContentPageLayout left sidebar with:
   - title: "Content"
   - folderClickBehavior: "link" (navigate to folder index pages)
   - folderDefaultState: "collapsed"
   - useSavedState: true
   - filterFn that hides: "inbox", "drafts", "publish_queue", ".templates", ".obsidian", "attachments"
   - sortFn that puts folders first, then alphabetical

3. Apply same Explorer config to defaultListPageLayout left sidebar.

4. Keep all other components as-is (Breadcrumbs, ArticleTitle, ContentMeta, TagList, Graph, TOC, Backlinks, Search, Darkmode).
  </action>
  <verify>Read quartz.layout.ts and confirm: footer has "Portfolio" link, Explorer has filterFn with "inbox" in hidden list, folderClickBehavior is "link".</verify>
  <done>Layout configured with filtered Explorer, portfolio-linked footer, and folder-first sorting</done>

  <name>Task 2: Create folder index pages and update homepage</name>
  <files>/Users/adial/Documents/GitHub/quartz/content/notes/index.md, /Users/adial/Documents/GitHub/quartz/content/index.md</files>
  <action>
1. Create/update content/notes/index.md with frontmatter:
   ---
   title: "Notes"
   ---
   Brief description: "Working notes, ideas, and published thinking."

2. Update content/index.md (homepage) with:
   ---
   title: "Model Citizen"
   ---

   Welcome content explaining this is a digital garden / knowledge base by Athan Dial. Keep it brief (3-4 sentences). Mention it's a companion to the [portfolio site](https://athan-dial.github.io/). Explain the site captures ideas from various sources, enriches them, and publishes the interesting ones. Link to the notes section.

   Do NOT use flowery language. Keep it direct and minimal. No emojis.

3. Check if any other content folders exist (sources/, ideas/, etc.) and create index.md files for each with appropriate title frontmatter. Only create for folders that actually exist in content/.
  </action>
  <verify>Read content/index.md - has "Model Citizen" title. Read content/notes/index.md - has "Notes" title. Check for other folder indexes matching existing folders.</verify>
  <done>Homepage explains site purpose, folder index pages provide meaningful Explorer labels</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Run `cd /Users/adial/Documents/GitHub/quartz && npx quartz build` - build succeeds
2. Grep quartz.layout.ts for "filterFn" - confirms Explorer filtering
3. Grep quartz.layout.ts for "Portfolio" - confirms footer link
4. Read content/index.md - confirms homepage content
</verification>

<success_criteria>
