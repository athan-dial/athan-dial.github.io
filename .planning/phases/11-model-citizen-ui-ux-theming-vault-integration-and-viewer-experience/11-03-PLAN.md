  <action>
Human verification checkpoint. What was built: Complete Model Citizen theme customization: executive blue color palette, Inter typography, 65ch line width, Explorer navigation with folder filtering, dark mode with contrast-safe colors, updated homepage and footer.

How to verify:
1. Visit https://athan-dial.github.io/model-citizen/ (may take 2-3 min for GitHub Actions)
2. Verify executive blue accent color on links and interactive elements
3. Click the dark mode toggle - verify text is readable (brightened blue links, light text on dark background)
4. Check Explorer sidebar: should show "Content" with folder navigation, should NOT show inbox/drafts/publish_queue
5. Check footer: should link to portfolio site and GitHub
6. Open DevTools mobile view (iPhone SE or similar): verify layout is usable, no horizontal scroll
7. Read a note page: verify line length feels comfortable (~65 characters), text is readable
  </action>
  <verify>User types "approved" or describes issues</verify>
  <done>User confirms visual quality of deployed theme</done>
</task>
