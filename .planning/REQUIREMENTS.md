## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Portfolio Content

- **PORT-01**: Case study archetype created (custom layouts for decision evidence)
- **PORT-02**: 2-3 polished case studies written (with authentic voice/positioning)
- **PORT-03**: Projects section configured (creations vs contributions)

### Advanced Features

- **ADV-01**: Downloadable PDF resume (browser print or Hugo plugin)
- **ADV-02**: Full design system (if minimal CSS insufficient)
- **ADV-03**: Thought leadership / writing section

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Blog/frequent posting | Focus is portfolio, not content marketing |
| Complex JavaScript interactions | Static site, minimal dependencies |
| Custom theme development | Using Hugo Resume with configuration only |
| Case study rewrites in v1 | Need voice/positioning work first; deferred to v2 |
| Full 1200+ line CSS port | Incompatible frameworks (Bootstrap vs Tailwind); minimal overrides for v1 |
| Netlify CMS integration | GitHub Pages deployment, no CMS needed |
