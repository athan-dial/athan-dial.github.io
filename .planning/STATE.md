## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date | Phase |
|----------|-----------|------|-------|
| 3-phase roadmap (vs 4-phase from research) | Quick depth setting; compress content + styling into single phase | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Phase 1 validation gate required | Single-page layout may not fit decision portfolio positioning; validate before investing in Phase 2 | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Defer case studies to v2 | Requires architectural fit validation; not critical for v1 working site | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Minimal CSS approach for v1 | Avoid porting 1200+ lines immediately; validate theme fit first | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Preserved critical GitHub Pages settings | Avoid deployment breakage by manually porting config rather than wholesale replacement | 2026-02-05 | 01-01 |
| Backed up layouts/ before theme change | Custom Blowfish partials may contain design patterns worth referencing later | 2026-02-05 | 01-01 |
| Used hugo mod tidy for clean removal | Ensure valid checksums and no ghost references vs manual go.mod editing | 2026-02-05 | 01-01 |
| Workflow-based folder taxonomy | 7 workflow folders (inbox → published) instead of topic categories | 2026-02-05 | 04-02 |
| Public vault strategy | Entire vault public on GitHub; Quartz ignorePatterns + ExplicitPublish plugin gate rendering | 2026-02-05 | 04-02 |
| .gitkeep files for empty folders | Ensures folder structure exists in git for fresh clones | 2026-02-05 | 04-02 |
| Rename repository to model-citizen | GitHub Pages project site path must match repository name for /model-citizen/ URL | 2026-02-05 | 04-01 |
| Separate repository approach (not monorepo) | Cleaner separation between vault and site; independent cloning; aligns with research | 2026-02-05 | 04-01 |
| Deploy on v4 branch (not main) | Quartz upstream uses v4 as default; minimizes deviation from upstream conventions | 2026-02-05 | 04-01 |
| Comprehensive hello-world sample note | Dual-purpose: validates schema AND explains Model Citizen vision to visitors | 2026-02-05 | 04-03 |
| Placeholder content strategy | Use generic company names and metrics until ChatGPT Deep Research outputs available | 2026-02-05 | 02-01 |
| PhD dual-listing approach | PhD appears in both experience (skills transfer) and education (credentials) sections | 2026-02-05 | 02-01 |
| Paragraph summaries (not bullets) | Structure: scope → outcomes → approach; reads like executive positioning | 2026-02-05 | 02-01 |
| System font stack for v1 | Achieves minimal/elegant aesthetic without font file complexity; defer custom fonts to v2 | 2026-02-05 | 02-02 |
| Bootstrap data-bs-theme for dark mode | Hugo Resume uses Bootstrap 5.3+ convention; cleaner than class-based toggling | 2026-02-05 | 02-02 |
| Executive blue (#1E3A5F) as primary accent | Professional executive positioning, near-monochromatic Apple aesthetic | 2026-02-05 | 02-02 |
| Host-side yt-dlp (not in container) | Hardened n8n image lacks Python; brew provides auto-updates | 2026-02-05 | 05-01 |
| Supersede 05-02 with host script | Simpler architecture; n8n orchestration deferred to v2 | 2026-02-05 | 05-02 |
| CSS via static/css/resume-override.css | Theme baseof.html already references this file; assets/css/custom.css was NOT in pipeline | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| Separate Skills vs Tools sections | Executive signal (capabilities) distinct from named technologies (tech stack) | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| Anchor nav instead of page links | Hugo Resume is single-page; Blowfish-era page links caused 404s | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| Disable Contact nav link | No /contact page exists; social links in header serve as contact | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| ed25519 SSH key without passphrase | Automated n8n-to-host SSH requires passwordless authentication | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Idempotency via output file check | Wrapper skips processing if output exists to prevent duplicate work on n8n retries | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Restricted tools for automation safety | Limit Claude to Read/Grep/Glob/WebFetch only to prevent accidental file modifications | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Atomic file writes with temp + rename | Prevents partial output if Claude crashes mid-execution | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Timeout with 600s default | Prevents hung processes from blocking pipeline; overridable per-task in frontmatter | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| JSON validation non-blocking | Attempt validation but save output regardless to preserve debugging info | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |

### Open Questions

- ~~Does Hugo Resume's single-page layout support decision portfolio positioning?~~ **RESOLVED:** User approved in Phase 1 Go/No-Go checkpoint
- ~~What typeface best achieves minimal/elegant aesthetic?~~ **RESOLVED:** System fonts for v1
- ~~What color palette replaces orange accent while maintaining Apple aesthetic?~~ **RESOLVED:** Executive blue (#1E3A5F)
- Will minimal CSS overrides suffice or is full design port needed? (Defer to v2 scope discussion)
- Should case studies migrate to `/projects/creations/` or stay in separate section? (Defer to v2)

## Session Continuity

**What Just Happened:**
- Phase 06-01 complete (SSH infrastructure and wrapper script):
  1. Generated ed25519 SSH key pair (~/.ssh/n8n_docker) for n8n authentication
  2. User enabled macOS Remote Login (checkpoint)
  3. Created .model-citizen/tasks/ and outputs/ directories with schema
  4. Built 218-line claude-task-runner.sh wrapper with idempotency, timeout, atomic writes
  5. Verified SSH connectivity from localhost (simulates Docker)
- Commits: 4e1acba (infrastructure), b97a6b8 (wrapper script) in model-citizen-vault repo
- All must_haves satisfied, self-check passed

**What's Next:**
- Model Citizen Phase 06 Plan 02: n8n workflow configuration (SSH node + task orchestration)
- Hugo Resume Phase 3: Production Deployment (still needs planning)

**Context for Next Session:**
- SSH infrastructure ready: host.docker.internal:22, user adial, key ~/.ssh/n8n_docker
- Wrapper command: ~/model-citizen-vault/scripts/claude-task-runner.sh --task-file <path>
- Task schema documented in .model-citizen/SCHEMA.md (YAML frontmatter format)
- Next: Configure n8n SSH node to invoke wrapper script, create test task
- Hugo Resume still at Phase 2 complete, Phase 3 deployment not started

**Last session:** 2026-02-06 11:28 UTC
**Stopped at:** Completed 06-01-PLAN.md
**Resume file:** .planning/phases/06-claude-code-integration/06-02-PLAN.md
