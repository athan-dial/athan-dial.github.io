## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date | Phase |
|----------|-----------|------|-------|
| 3-phase roadmap (vs 4-phase from research) | Quick depth setting; compress content + styling into single phase | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Phase 1 validation gate required | Single-page layout may not fit decision portfolio positioning; validate before investing in Phase 2 | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Defer case studies to v2 | Requires architectural fit validation; not critical for v1 working site | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Minimal CSS approach for v1 | Avoid porting 1200+ lines immediately; validate theme fit first | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Preserved critical GitHub Pages settings | Avoid deployment breakage by manually porting config rather than wholesale replacement | 2026-02-05 | 01-01 |
| Backed up layouts/ before theme change | Custom Blowfish partials may contain design patterns worth referencing later | 2026-02-05 | 01-01 |
| Used hugo mod tidy for clean removal | Ensure valid checksums and no ghost references vs manual go.mod editing | 2026-02-05 | 01-01 |
| Workflow-based folder taxonomy | 7 workflow folders (inbox → published) instead of topic categories | 2026-02-05 | 04-02 |
| Public vault strategy | Entire vault public on GitHub; Quartz ignorePatterns + ExplicitPublish plugin gate rendering | 2026-02-05 | 04-02 |
| .gitkeep files for empty folders | Ensures folder structure exists in git for fresh clones | 2026-02-05 | 04-02 |
| Rename repository to model-citizen | GitHub Pages project site path must match repository name for /model-citizen/ URL | 2026-02-05 | 04-01 |
| Separate repository approach (not monorepo) | Cleaner separation between vault and site; independent cloning; aligns with research | 2026-02-05 | 04-01 |
| Deploy on v4 branch (not main) | Quartz upstream uses v4 as default; minimizes deviation from upstream conventions | 2026-02-05 | 04-01 |
| Comprehensive hello-world sample note | Dual-purpose: validates schema AND explains Model Citizen vision to visitors | 2026-02-05 | 04-03 |
| Placeholder content strategy | Use generic company names and metrics until ChatGPT Deep Research outputs available | 2026-02-05 | 02-01 |
| PhD dual-listing approach | PhD appears in both experience (skills transfer) and education (credentials) sections | 2026-02-05 | 02-01 |
| Paragraph summaries (not bullets) | Structure: scope → outcomes → approach; reads like executive positioning | 2026-02-05 | 02-01 |
| System font stack for v1 | Achieves minimal/elegant aesthetic without font file complexity; defer custom fonts to v2 | 2026-02-05 | 02-02 |
| Bootstrap data-bs-theme for dark mode | Hugo Resume uses Bootstrap 5.3+ convention; cleaner than class-based toggling | 2026-02-05 | 02-02 |
| Executive blue (#1E3A5F) as primary accent | Professional executive positioning, near-monochromatic Apple aesthetic | 2026-02-05 | 02-02 |
| Host-side yt-dlp (not in container) | Hardened n8n image lacks Python; brew provides auto-updates | 2026-02-05 | 05-01 |
| Supersede 05-02 with host script | Simpler architecture; n8n orchestration deferred to v2 | 2026-02-05 | 05-02 |
| CSS via static/css/resume-override.css | Theme baseof.html already references this file; assets/css/custom.css was NOT in pipeline | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| Separate Skills vs Tools sections | Executive signal (capabilities) distinct from named technologies (tech stack) | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| Anchor nav instead of page links | Hugo Resume is single-page; Blowfish-era page links caused 404s | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| Disable Contact nav link | No /contact page exists; social links in header serve as contact | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| ed25519 SSH key without passphrase | Automated n8n-to-host SSH requires passwordless authentication | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Idempotency via output file check | Wrapper skips processing if output exists to prevent duplicate work on n8n retries | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Restricted tools for automation safety | Limit Claude to Read/Grep/Glob/WebFetch only to prevent accidental file modifications | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Atomic file writes with temp + rename | Prevents partial output if Claude crashes mid-execution | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Timeout with 600s default | Prevents hung processes from blocking pipeline; overridable per-task in frontmatter | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| JSON validation non-blocking | Attempt validation but save output regardless to preserve debugging info | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Use gtimeout from coreutils | macOS lacks GNU timeout; coreutils provides gtimeout command | 2026-02-06 | 06-02 |
| Strip markdown code fences from Claude output | Claude Code wraps JSON in ```json fences; sed strips before validation | 2026-02-06 | 06-02 |
| Full paths for SSH reliability | SSH sessions don't inherit user PATH; use /opt/homebrew/bin/gtimeout and ~/.local/bin/claude | 2026-02-06 | 06-02 |
| Document setup-token requirement | SSH sessions can't access macOS Keychain; setup-token creates persistent auth | 2026-02-06 | 06-02 |
| Prompt chaining over mega-prompts | Separate prompts per enrichment task gets Claude's full attention; prevents dropped steps | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| Hybrid orchestration (summary first, then parallel) | Balances dependencies (ideas need summary) with performance (parallel where possible) | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| Flexible extraction (JSON + YAML) | Support both formats gracefully; wrapper may return either structure | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| Vault-aware synthesis via keyword search | Simple grep-based for v1; semantic embeddings deferred to later phase | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| Light validation with quality flags | Set needs_review flag but don't block pipeline; partial enrichment acceptable | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| State-based YAML parsing | AWK with flags (in_tags, in_quotes) handles nested structures robustly | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| n8n as orchestration layer | Visual workflow management, easy param modification, future automation integration | 2026-02-06 | 07-02 |
| Status pre-check via SSH grep | Simple idempotency check without database or state file needed | 2026-02-06 | 07-02 |
| 15min timeout for enrichment | Accommodates multiple Claude invocations (summarization → tagging → ideas) | 2026-02-06 | 07-02 |
| Daily log append pattern | Human-readable audit trail without database complexity for v1 | 2026-02-06 | 07-02 |
| Nested metadata extraction order | Check .metadata.tags before root .tags for wrapper format compatibility | 2026-02-06 | 07-03 |
| File descriptor parsing for ideas | Use bash fd 3 for multi-line markdown over AWK state machine | 2026-02-06 | 07-03 |
| Deferred temp file cleanup | Keep temp files until dependent operations complete | 2026-02-06 | 07-03 |

## Session Continuity

**What Just Happened:**
- Phase 07-03 complete (enrichment pipeline gap closure):
  1. Fixed tagging extraction to handle nested .metadata structure (9 tags extracted)
  2. Fixed idea card creation to parse .output field format (3 cards generated)
  3. Fixed quality checks by deferring temp file cleanup (status updated to enriched)
  4. Verified complete enrichment: tags, quotes, takeaways, status, timestamp
  5. Test source now has full enrichment metadata in frontmatter
- Commits: e57c544, de29a2d, dc0b3e5 (model-citizen-vault)
- Phase 07 COMPLETE ✓ - All enrichment types working: summaries, tags, idea cards
- Gap closure: 25% → 100% enrichment goal achievement

**What's Next:**
- Model Citizen Phase 08: Review & Approval UI (1 plan remaining)
- Hugo Resume Phase 3: Production Deployment (still needs planning)

**Context for Next Session:**
- **Phase 07 Complete (with gap closure):** Full enrichment pipeline working end-to-end
- All enrichment types operational: summaries ✓, tagging ✓, idea cards ✓, status updates ✓
- Verification passed: Test source has 9 tags, 3 quotes, 5 takeaways, 3 idea cards, status=enriched
- Gap closure fixed three extraction bugs: nested JSON parsing, markdown file creation, temp file lifecycle
- Phase 8 ready to start: Can read complete enrichment metadata from frontmatter for human review UI
- Model Citizen at 100% plans complete (10/10 including gap closure), 2 phases remain (08: Review UI, 09: Publish Sync)
- Hugo Resume still at Phase 2 complete, Phase 3 deployment not started
