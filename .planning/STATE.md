## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date | Phase |
|----------|-----------|------|-------|
| 3-phase roadmap (vs 4-phase from research) | Quick depth setting; compress content + styling into single phase | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Phase 1 validation gate required | Single-page layout may not fit decision portfolio positioning; validate before investing in Phase 2 | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Defer case studies to v2 | Requires architectural fit validation; not critical for v1 working site | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Minimal CSS approach for v1 | Avoid porting 1200+ lines immediately; validate theme fit first | 2026-02-04 | Planning |
| Preserved critical GitHub Pages settings | Avoid deployment breakage by manually porting config rather than wholesale replacement | 2026-02-05 | 01-01 |
| Backed up layouts/ before theme change | Custom Blowfish partials may contain design patterns worth referencing later | 2026-02-05 | 01-01 |
| Used hugo mod tidy for clean removal | Ensure valid checksums and no ghost references vs manual go.mod editing | 2026-02-05 | 01-01 |
| Workflow-based folder taxonomy | 7 workflow folders (inbox → published) instead of topic categories | 2026-02-05 | 04-02 |
| Public vault strategy | Entire vault public on GitHub; Quartz ignorePatterns + ExplicitPublish plugin gate rendering | 2026-02-05 | 04-02 |
| .gitkeep files for empty folders | Ensures folder structure exists in git for fresh clones | 2026-02-05 | 04-02 |
| Rename repository to model-citizen | GitHub Pages project site path must match repository name for /model-citizen/ URL | 2026-02-05 | 04-01 |
| Separate repository approach (not monorepo) | Cleaner separation between vault and site; independent cloning; aligns with research | 2026-02-05 | 04-01 |
| Deploy on v4 branch (not main) | Quartz upstream uses v4 as default; minimizes deviation from upstream conventions | 2026-02-05 | 04-01 |
| Comprehensive hello-world sample note | Dual-purpose: validates schema AND explains Model Citizen vision to visitors | 2026-02-05 | 04-03 |
| Placeholder content strategy | Use generic company names and metrics until ChatGPT Deep Research outputs available | 2026-02-05 | 02-01 |
| PhD dual-listing approach | PhD appears in both experience (skills transfer) and education (credentials) sections | 2026-02-05 | 02-01 |
| Paragraph summaries (not bullets) | Structure: scope → outcomes → approach; reads like executive positioning | 2026-02-05 | 02-01 |
| System font stack for v1 | Achieves minimal/elegant aesthetic without font file complexity; defer custom fonts to v2 | 2026-02-05 | 02-02 |
| Bootstrap data-bs-theme for dark mode | Hugo Resume uses Bootstrap 5.3+ convention; cleaner than class-based toggling | 2026-02-05 | 02-02 |
| Executive blue (#1E3A5F) as primary accent | Professional executive positioning, near-monochromatic Apple aesthetic | 2026-02-05 | 02-02 |
| Host-side yt-dlp (not in container) | Hardened n8n image lacks Python; brew provides auto-updates | 2026-02-05 | 05-01 |
| Supersede 05-02 with host script | Simpler architecture; n8n orchestration deferred to v2 | 2026-02-05 | 05-02 |
| CSS via static/css/resume-override.css | Theme baseof.html already references this file; assets/css/custom.css was NOT in pipeline | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| Separate Skills vs Tools sections | Executive signal (capabilities) distinct from named technologies (tech stack) | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| Anchor nav instead of page links | Hugo Resume is single-page; Blowfish-era page links caused 404s | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| Disable Contact nav link | No /contact page exists; social links in header serve as contact | 2026-02-05 | 02-03 |
| ed25519 SSH key without passphrase | Automated n8n-to-host SSH requires passwordless authentication | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Idempotency via output file check | Wrapper skips processing if output exists to prevent duplicate work on n8n retries | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Restricted tools for automation safety | Limit Claude to Read/Grep/Glob/WebFetch only to prevent accidental file modifications | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Atomic file writes with temp + rename | Prevents partial output if Claude crashes mid-execution | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Timeout with 600s default | Prevents hung processes from blocking pipeline; overridable per-task in frontmatter | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| JSON validation non-blocking | Attempt validation but save output regardless to preserve debugging info | 2026-02-06 | 06-01 |
| Use gtimeout from coreutils | macOS lacks GNU timeout; coreutils provides gtimeout command | 2026-02-06 | 06-02 |
| Strip markdown code fences from Claude output | Claude Code wraps JSON in ```json fences; sed strips before validation | 2026-02-06 | 06-02 |
| Full paths for SSH reliability | SSH sessions don't inherit user PATH; use /opt/homebrew/bin/gtimeout and ~/.local/bin/claude | 2026-02-06 | 06-02 |
| Document setup-token requirement | SSH sessions can't access macOS Keychain; setup-token creates persistent auth | 2026-02-06 | 06-02 |
| Prompt chaining over mega-prompts | Separate prompts per enrichment task gets Claude's full attention; prevents dropped steps | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| Hybrid orchestration (summary first, then parallel) | Balances dependencies (ideas need summary) with performance (parallel where possible) | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| Flexible extraction (JSON + YAML) | Support both formats gracefully; wrapper may return either structure | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| Vault-aware synthesis via keyword search | Simple grep-based for v1; semantic embeddings deferred to later phase | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| Light validation with quality flags | Set needs_review flag but don't block pipeline; partial enrichment acceptable | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| State-based YAML parsing | AWK with flags (in_tags, in_quotes) handles nested structures robustly | 2026-02-06 | 07-01 |
| n8n as orchestration layer | Visual workflow management, easy param modification, future automation integration | 2026-02-06 | 07-02 |
| Status pre-check via SSH grep | Simple idempotency check without database or state file needed | 2026-02-06 | 07-02 |
| 15min timeout for enrichment | Accommodates multiple Claude invocations (summarization → tagging → ideas) | 2026-02-06 | 07-02 |
| Daily log append pattern | Human-readable audit trail without database complexity for v1 | 2026-02-06 | 07-02 |
| Nested metadata extraction order | Check .metadata.tags before root .tags for wrapper format compatibility | 2026-02-06 | 07-03 |
| File descriptor parsing for ideas | Use bash fd 3 for multi-line markdown over AWK state machine | 2026-02-06 | 07-03 |
| Deferred temp file cleanup | Keep temp files until dependent operations complete | 2026-02-06 | 07-03 |
| Log both skipped and enriched sources | Complete audit trail requires capturing all script invocations | 2026-02-06 | 07-04 |
| Early-exit logging pattern | Scripts often exit early; log outcome before any early exits | 2026-02-06 | 07-04 |
| Obsidian Bases over Dataview DQL | Native core plugin, no community plugin dependency | 2026-02-06 | 08-01 |
| Vault repos moved to iCloud Obsidian dir | Seamless vault access in Obsidian without manual vault addition | 2026-02-06 | 08-01 |
| Dual approval: folder OR frontmatter | Folder-based for simplicity, frontmatter for programmatic filtering | 2026-02-06 | 08-01 |
| Scripts in repo at model-citizen/vault/ | Vault infrastructure not deployed yet; scripts are implementation-ready | 2026-02-08 | 09-01 |
| Hash-based idempotency for publish sync | CSV tracking file prevents re-publishing unchanged notes | 2026-02-08 | 09-01 |
| Missing assets log warnings only | Resilient pipeline continues with partial assets rather than failing | 2026-02-08 | 09-01 |
| Reuse existing hello-world.md for e2e test | Already in publish_queue with status: publish; no need to create new test note | 2026-02-08 | 09-02 |
| PIL placeholder OG image | No existing profile photo; ImageMagick unavailable; PIL generates 1200x630 executive blue placeholder | 2026-02-08 | 03-01 |
| Leave orphaned Blowfish content | Old theme pages (consulting/, advisory/, case-studies/) exist but aren't linked from Hugo Resume; non-blocking for v1 | 2026-02-08 | 03-01 |
| Change Pages source from GitHub Actions to branch | Quartz workflow was overriding gh-pages branch deployment; switched to "Deploy from a branch" mode | 2026-02-09 | 03-01 |
| Tag-based routing for content curation | More flexible - users can tag from anywhere without moving notes manually | 2026-02-13 | 10-01 |
| Five content sections instead of seven workflow stages | Simpler taxonomy focused on content type rather than workflow state | 2026-02-13 | 10-01 |
| rsync --delete for vault-to-quartz sync | True mirror - removes deleted content from Quartz automatically | 2026-02-13 | 10-01 |

### Open Questions

- ~~Does Hugo Resume's single-page layout support decision portfolio positioning?~~ **RESOLVED:** User approved in Phase 1 Go/No-Go checkpoint
- ~~What typeface best achieves minimal/elegant aesthetic?~~ **RESOLVED:** System fonts for v1
- ~~What color palette replaces orange accent while maintaining Apple aesthetic?~~ **RESOLVED:** Executive blue (#1E3A5F)
- Will minimal CSS overrides suffice or is full design port needed? (Defer to v2 scope discussion)
- Should case studies migrate to `/projects/creations/` or stay in separate section? (Defer to v2)
