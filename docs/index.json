I loved the rigor—designing experiments where the question itself is ambiguous, building evaluation frameworks from scratch because no playbook exists. But somewhere between optimizing multi-omics pipelines and presenting at lab meetings, I realized the most valuable skill I\u0026rsquo;d developed wasn\u0026rsquo;t technical depth. It was designing decision systems under resource constraints.\nIn my PhD, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t just analyzing data. I was making judgment calls: Which experiments maximize learning per dollar? How do we design validation that catches false positives before they waste months of work? What counts as \u0026ldquo;sufficient evidence\u0026rdquo; when stakeholders disagree on the underlying question? These weren\u0026rsquo;t biology problems—they were decision-architecture problems.\nWhen I transitioned to drug discovery ML, I brought that research-grade rigor with me. The questions changed (Which model architecture balances precision vs. recall for this specific drug target? How do we evaluate \u0026ldquo;model quality\u0026rdquo; when ground truth won\u0026rsquo;t exist for 2 years?), but the decision-making muscle stayed the same: First-principles thinking about what counts as evidence, explicit tradeoffs, and systems that prevent \u0026ldquo;metric theater.\u0026rdquo;\nMost data science leaders I meet are strong on either product intuition (prioritization, stakeholder alignment) or technical depth (architecture, evaluation frameworks), but rarely both. My PhD gave me something different: the ability to design evaluation frameworks for problems where the right answer isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious. That\u0026rsquo;s the bridge between \u0026ldquo;PhD-trained in multi-omics analysis\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;product-tested in drug discovery ML.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat I Bring # Research-Grade Rigor: I design evaluation systems from first principles, not templates. I know how to ask \u0026ldquo;what counts as evidence here?\u0026rdquo; and build measurement systems that answer it.\nProduct Judgment + Technical Depth: Most people are 2 out of 3 (product + leadership, or technical + leadership). I\u0026rsquo;m all three—I can frame the problem, design the architecture, and ship the outcome.\nDecision Evidence, Not Achievements: I document decision systems, not activity. My case studies show the problem context, the decision frame, the tradeoffs, and the measurable outcomes. No \u0026ldquo;metric theater.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy This Matters # In a world of AI-generated insights and \u0026ldquo;data-driven\u0026rdquo; buzzwords, the bottleneck isn\u0026rsquo;t generating analyses—it\u0026rsquo;s making good decisions under uncertainty. The teams that win aren\u0026rsquo;t the ones with the most dashboards. They\u0026rsquo;re the ones with clear decision systems: North star + guardrails, explicit ownership, and repeatable evaluation frameworks that prevent false confidence.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what I build. That\u0026rsquo;s what I bring. That\u0026rsquo;s what my decision portfolio documents.\nWant to see how I think?

Product-tested in drug discovery ML.\nI design decision systems for ambiguous, high-stakes problems. I combine research-grade evaluation rigor with product judgment to ship measurable outcomes. I communicate in decisions, metrics, and tradeoffs—not activity.\nDecision Systems Portfolio # System 1: Preventing Metric Theater in Drug Discovery ML # Decision Context: Data science teams were presenting accuracy metrics without reliability monitoring, creating false confidence in model predictions for multimillion-dollar compound selection decisions. Each compound decision represented $2M+ in development costs, but we lacked visibility into model performance degradation over time.\nMy Decision: I designed a combined evaluation framework (offline validation + online monitoring) instead of choosing between them. This required coordinating across ML, platform, and biology teams to establish baseline validation and production monitoring infrastructure.\nOutcome: De-risked $2M+ in compound development by catching model degradation 3 months earlier than previous processes. The framework identified performance drift in two models before they influenced compound selection decisions. Established evaluation framework as standard for all discovery ML models.\nKey Tradeoff: I sacrificed implementation speed (3 months vs. 2 weeks for offline-only) to gain defensibility and early warning signals. The infrastructure investment paid off across multiple models and use cases.\nFull Case Study →\nSystem 2: Reducing Pipeline Latency to Accelerate Decision Velocity # Decision Context: Analytics pipelines took 4-6 hours to run, blocking daily decision-making for 6+ discovery teams. Teams couldn\u0026rsquo;t iterate on compound prioritization during meetings, forcing them to reconvene later—slowing R\u0026amp;D velocity and reducing confidence in data-driven decisions.\nMy Decision: I redesigned the data warehouse architecture using dbt + S3/Parquet with incremental models and materialized views. I prioritized latency reduction over feature completeness to unblock the decision-making bottleneck first.\nOutcome: Reduced pipeline runtime from 4-6 hours to 20-30 minutes (85-90% reduction), enabling same-day iteration on compound prioritization. Reduced compute costs by ~$75k/year through architectural optimization. Analytics became the default path for nomination decisions across all discovery teams.\nKey Tradeoff: I deferred some advanced analytics features to focus on infrastructure reliability and speed. Teams could make faster decisions with core metrics instead of waiting longer for comprehensive dashboards.\nFull Case Study →\nSystem 3: PhD Research - Multi-Omics Pipeline Design Under Resource Constraints # Decision Context: During my PhD at McMaster University (2017-2022), I designed multi-omics analysis pipelines where the right evaluation approach wasn\u0026rsquo;t obvious from existing literature. I had to decide how to allocate limited sequencing budget across validation experiments while maintaining statistical rigor.\nMy Decision: I developed evaluation frameworks from first principles, explicitly modeling the cost-benefit tradeoffs of different validation strategies. I prioritized experiments that maximized learning per dollar while maintaining sufficient statistical power.\nOutcome: Successfully translated complex multi-omics data into actionable biological insights that informed experimental design. Published peer-reviewed research demonstrating the validity of the evaluation approach. Developed the \u0026ldquo;design decision systems under resource constraints\u0026rdquo; skillset that I now apply to product decisions.\nKey Tradeoff: I chose statistical rigor over comprehensive coverage—validating core hypotheses thoroughly rather than testing everything superficially. This approach prevented false confidence while staying within budget constraints.\nCurrent Role # Data Research Lead | Montai Therapeutics | 2022-Present\nI lead decision systems design for drug discovery analytics, owning evaluation frameworks, data architecture, and stakeholder alignment.
