I loved the rigor—designing experiments where the question itself is ambiguous, building evaluation frameworks from scratch because no playbook exists. But somewhere between optimizing multi-omics pipelines and presenting at lab meetings, I realized the most valuable skill I\u0026rsquo;d developed wasn\u0026rsquo;t technical depth. It was designing decision systems under resource constraints.\nIn my PhD, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t just analyzing data. I was making judgment calls: Which experiments maximize learning per dollar? How do we design validation that catches false positives before they waste months of work? What counts as \u0026ldquo;sufficient evidence\u0026rdquo; when stakeholders disagree on the underlying question? These weren\u0026rsquo;t biology problems—they were decision-architecture problems.\nWhen I transitioned to drug discovery ML, I brought that research-grade rigor with me. The questions changed (Which model architecture balances precision vs. recall for this specific drug target? How do we evaluate \u0026ldquo;model quality\u0026rdquo; when ground truth won\u0026rsquo;t exist for 2 years?), but the decision-making muscle stayed the same: First-principles thinking about what counts as evidence, explicit tradeoffs, and systems that prevent \u0026ldquo;metric theater.\u0026rdquo;\nMost data science leaders I meet are strong on either product intuition (prioritization, stakeholder alignment) or technical depth (architecture, evaluation frameworks), but rarely both. My PhD gave me something different: the ability to design evaluation frameworks for problems where the right answer isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious. That\u0026rsquo;s the bridge between \u0026ldquo;PhD-trained in multi-omics analysis\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;product-tested in drug discovery ML.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat I Bring # Research-Grade Rigor: I design evaluation systems from first principles, not templates. I know how to ask \u0026ldquo;what counts as evidence here?\u0026rdquo; and build measurement systems that answer it.\nProduct Judgment + Technical Depth: Most people are 2 out of 3 (product + leadership, or technical + leadership). I\u0026rsquo;m all three—I can frame the problem, design the architecture, and ship the outcome.\nDecision Evidence, Not Achievements: I document decision systems, not activity. My case studies show the problem context, the decision frame, the tradeoffs, and the measurable outcomes. No \u0026ldquo;metric theater.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy This Matters # In a world of AI-generated insights and \u0026ldquo;data-driven\u0026rdquo; buzzwords, the bottleneck isn\u0026rsquo;t generating analyses—it\u0026rsquo;s making good decisions under uncertainty. The teams that win aren\u0026rsquo;t the ones with the most dashboards. They\u0026rsquo;re the ones with clear decision systems: North star + guardrails, explicit ownership, and repeatable evaluation frameworks that prevent false confidence.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what I build. That\u0026rsquo;s what I bring. That\u0026rsquo;s what my decision portfolio documents.\nWant to see how I think?

Product-tested in drug discovery ML.\nI design decision systems for ambiguous, high-stakes problems. I combine research-grade evaluation rigor with product judgment to ship measurable outcomes. I communicate in decisions, metrics, and tradeoffs—not activity.\nDecision Systems Portfolio # System 1: Preventing Metric Theater in Drug Discovery ML # Decision Context: Data science teams were presenting accuracy metrics without reliability monitoring, creating false confidence in model predictions for multimillion-dollar compound selection decisions. Each compound decision represented $2M+ in development costs, but we lacked visibility into model performance degradation over time.\nMy Decision: I designed a combined evaluation framework (offline validation + online monitoring) instead of choosing between them. This required coordinating across ML, platform, and biology teams to establish baseline validation and production monitoring infrastructure.\nOutcome: De-risked $2M+ in compound development by catching model degradation 3 months earlier than previous processes. The framework identified performance drift in two models before they influenced compound selection decisions. Established evaluation framework as standard for all discovery ML models.\nKey Tradeoff: I sacrificed implementation speed (3 months vs. 2 weeks for offline-only) to gain defensibility and early warning signals. The infrastructure investment paid off across multiple models and use cases.\nFull Case Study →\nSystem 2: Reducing Pipeline Latency to Accelerate Decision Velocity # Decision Context: Analytics pipelines took 4-6 hours to run, blocking daily decision-making for 6+ discovery teams. Teams couldn\u0026rsquo;t iterate on compound prioritization during meetings, forcing them to reconvene later—slowing R\u0026amp;D velocity and reducing confidence in data-driven decisions.\nMy Decision: I redesigned the data warehouse architecture using dbt + S3/Parquet with incremental models and materialized views. I prioritized latency reduction over feature completeness to unblock the decision-making bottleneck first.\nOutcome: Reduced pipeline runtime from 4-6 hours to 20-30 minutes (85-90% reduction), enabling same-day iteration on compound prioritization. Reduced compute costs by ~$75k/year through architectural optimization. Analytics became the default path for nomination decisions across all discovery teams.\nKey Tradeoff: I deferred some advanced analytics features to focus on infrastructure reliability and speed. Teams could make faster decisions with core metrics instead of waiting longer for comprehensive dashboards.\nFull Case Study →\nSystem 3: PhD Research - Multi-Omics Pipeline Design Under Resource Constraints # Decision Context: During my PhD at McMaster University (2017-2022), I designed multi-omics analysis pipelines where the right evaluation approach wasn\u0026rsquo;t obvious from existing literature. I had to decide how to allocate limited sequencing budget across validation experiments while maintaining statistical rigor.\nMy Decision: I developed evaluation frameworks from first principles, explicitly modeling the cost-benefit tradeoffs of different validation strategies. I prioritized experiments that maximized learning per dollar while maintaining sufficient statistical power.\nOutcome: Successfully translated complex multi-omics data into actionable biological insights that informed experimental design. Published peer-reviewed research demonstrating the validity of the evaluation approach. Developed the \u0026ldquo;design decision systems under resource constraints\u0026rdquo; skillset that I now apply to product decisions.\nKey Tradeoff: I chose statistical rigor over comprehensive coverage—validating core hypotheses thoroughly rather than testing everything superficially. This approach prevented false confidence while staying within budget constraints.\nCurrent Role # Data Research Lead | Montai Therapeutics | 2022-Present\nI lead decision systems design for drug discovery analytics, owning evaluation frameworks, data architecture, and stakeholder alignment.

Our core IP hinged on generating novel analog compounds (\u0026ldquo;Anthrologs\u0026rdquo;) through proprietary AI models — but the internal generative model produced ~360M virtual compounds with uncertain synthetic feasibility. Meanwhile, XtalPi offered curated, higher-confidence AI-suggested compounds from external sources.\nFacts:\nLate 2025: Montai\u0026rsquo;s core IP = generating novel analog compounds (\u0026ldquo;Anthrologs\u0026rdquo;) Problem: Internal generative model produced ~360M virtual compounds, but many not synthesizable/uncertain value Alternative: XtalPi (external partner) offered curated AI-suggested compounds (more drug-like) Stakes: Resource allocation - invest in internal model improvement OR buy external suggestions? The CSO (Margo) needed an evidence-based recommendation by December 1, 2025. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t a philosophical debate about build vs buy — it was a portfolio allocation decision with measurable ROI implications.

The second repeated a pattern from the nomination scaling work: treating chemist expertise as validation rather than design input. The third was standard risk mitigation we should have applied but didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nWhat this taught me about decision-making:\nThis analysis validated three principles about strategic framing:\nQuantitative framing transforms opinions into evidence — the ROI model gave the CSO a concrete basis for decision rather than competing gut feelings about build vs buy Build vs buy is rarely binary — hybrid approaches often dominate pure strategies, especially when timelines and uncertainty favor hedging Executive decisions need clear options plus a recommendation — presenting \u0026ldquo;here\u0026rsquo;s the data, you decide\u0026rdquo; abdicates leadership; executives want your synthesis and recommendation backed by evidence How this informs future decisions:\nThese meta-takeaways now guide my approach to strategic analysis:\nAlways model tradeoffs quantitatively when stakes are high — even \u0026ldquo;napkin math\u0026rdquo; beats handwaving about strategic direction Build vs buy is a portfolio decision, not an all-in bet — maintaining optionality through hybrid approaches preserves strategic flexibility Strategic patience requires near-term wins to buy time for long bets — the hybrid worked because XtalPi compounds delivered wins while we improved internal models Factual Evidence Citations:\nProject Inventory p.9 (XtalPi collaboration entry) Decision Systems p.14-15 (detailed analysis narrative) Slack DM (William→Athan analysis goal) Jake Ombach Slack (quantitative scenario results) ","date":"15 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/case-studies/xtalpi-build-vs-buy-analysis-montai/","section":"Case Studies","summary":"","title":"Build vs Buy: Strategic Analysis for Analog Generation","type":"case-studies"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/build-vs-buy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Build-vs-Buy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/executive-communication/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Executive-Communication","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/roi-modeling/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Roi-Modeling","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/strategic-analysis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Strategic-Analysis","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cross-functional/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cross-Functional","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/decision-frameworks/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Decision-Frameworks","type":"tags"},{"content":" Context # By 2025, Montai ran multiple concurrent R\u0026amp;D experiments — AI model iterations, assay validations, Anthrolog generation improvements. Each experiment had implicit goals but lacked explicit success criteria. The result: debates about \u0026ldquo;when to pivot\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;when to scale\u0026rdquo; became opinion-driven rather than evidence-backed.\nFacts:\nBy 2025: Multiple concurrent experiments (AI models, assays, Anthrolog generations) Problem: Unclear success criteria per experiment (when to pivot? when to scale?) Example confusion: \u0026ldquo;AI model improved accuracy\u0026rdquo; but didn\u0026rsquo;t translate to better compound selection Stakes: Wasted months on meandering experiments without clear learning goals The core issue traced back to a fundamental principle from my PhD training: experiments without pre-defined hypotheses produce data, not learning. In academic research, you write your aims before running experiments.

Learning Agendas moved the organization from opinion-driven debates (\u0026ldquo;I think this model is good enough\u0026rdquo;) to evidence-based pivots (\u0026ldquo;The agenda said we\u0026rsquo;d pivot if accuracy didn\u0026rsquo;t reach X, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t reach X\u0026rdquo;).

By launching broadly without pilots, I created confusion and had to backfill with one-on-one sessions. A slower, example-driven rollout would have accelerated actual adoption.\nWhat this taught me about decision-making:\nThis project validated a core thesis about PhD → Product skill transfer:\nAcademic experimental design translates directly to business decisions — the logic of hypothesis → test → pivot works whether you\u0026rsquo;re running gels or evaluating AI models Pre-commitment to decision criteria reduces politics — when stakeholders agree on thresholds before seeing data, debates shift from \u0026ldquo;is this good enough?\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;did we hit the bar?\u0026rdquo; Lightweight structure beats heavyweight docs — scientists adopted one-page agendas because they didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like bureaucracy; thoroughness without pragmatism kills adoption How this informs future decisions:\nThree principles now shape how I design decision systems:\nAlways define success criteria before starting work, not retroactively — I now refuse to approve projects without clear \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ll pivot if X\u0026rdquo; statements Decision frameworks are products — they need user research, design iteration, and adoption strategies, not just documentation Cultural change requires artifacts plus enforcement — the Learning Agenda template worked because program reviews explicitly required agendas, not just because the doc existed Factual Evidence Citations:\nProject Inventory p.7 (Learning Agenda entry) Decision Systems p.12-13 (detailed framework description) Quantitative Outcomes (cycle time metric) Conecta Ops notes (10/28/25 feedback deadline) ","date":"1 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/case-studies/learning-agenda-framework-montai/","section":"Case Studies","summary":"","title":"Learning Agendas: Bringing Research Rigor to Product Decisions","type":"case-studies"},{"content":"","date":"1 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/phd-transfer/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Phd-Transfer","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/data-quality/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Data-Quality","type":"tags"},{"content":" Context # Mid-2025 was a period of rapid growth at Montai — more programs, more models, more data flowing through pipelines built for smaller scale.
