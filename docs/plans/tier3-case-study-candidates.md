# Tier 3 Case Study Candidates (Montai)

These case studies are lower priority but valuable for demonstrating additional dimensions:

## 1. Bridging Computational and Experimental Teams (Anthrograph Integration)

**Source:** Archaeology p.6 (Project Inventory), p.23-24 (Execution Leadership)

**Key Facts:**
- Timeline: Q3 2023 - Q2 2024
- Problem: Pathway Solutions (in silico Anthrologs) + MedChem (experimental analogs) working in silos
- Solution: Formed Anthrograph Working Group, coordinated data pipelines, regular sync meetings
- Outcome: Combined view of all analogs (predicted + made), improved alignment, fewer duplications

**Why Tier 3:**
- Less quantitative impact than Tier 1/2 cases
- More organizational process than strategic/technical depth
- Complements other leadership stories but not essential

**Potential Angle:** Cross-functional leadership, stakeholder alignment, data integration

## 2. Data Pipeline Architecture (dbt Implementation)

**Source:** Archaeology p.16-17 (Technical Architecture)

**Key Facts:**
- Timeline: 2023 - mid-2024
- Problem: Manual SQL scripts, slow data refresh (2-3 days), inconsistent transformations
- Solution: Implemented dbt for warehouse transformations, automated pipeline
- Outcome: Same-day data updates, consistent metrics, 80% latency reduction

**Why Tier 3:**
- Significant technical achievement but less "decision evidence" (more execution)
- Overlaps with Nomination Pipeline story (which includes dbt as component)
- Strong for technical depth but less product judgment demonstration

**Potential Angle:** Technical architecture, data engineering, automation

## Decision: Defer Tier 3 Until Tier 1-2 Complete

**Rationale:**
1. Portfolio already demonstrates breadth with Tier 1-2 (5 case studies)
2. Tier 3 adds length without proportional value for "decision evidence" positioning
3. Can revisit if user feedback indicates gaps (e.g., need more cross-functional OR more technical architecture)

**Recommendation:** Complete Tier 1-2 factual scaffolds, await voice research, evaluate Tier 3 need post-launch.
