# Montai Case Studies Implementation Status

## Completed (Factual Scaffolds)

✅ **Tasks 1-5:** Extracted factual scaffolds for 5 Tier 1-2 case studies:
1. Scaling AI-Driven Nominations (product strategy + architecture)
2. STAT6 Data Crisis Response (execution leadership + incident response)
3. Learning Agenda Framework (product strategy + PhD transfer)
4. XtalPi Build vs Buy (strategic analysis + executive communication)
5. Shiny Standardization (technical architecture + developer experience)

**Status:** All case studies have:
- Complete factual structure (Context → Ownership → Decision Frame → Outcome → Reflection)
- Accurate metrics from archaeology document
- [VOICE] markers for authentic content overlay
- Proper Hugo frontmatter and tags
- Git commits documenting extraction

---

## Pending (Voice Overlay)

⏳ **Awaiting:** ChatGPT Deep Research outputs for:
- Voice & Style Guide (signature vocabulary, sentence patterns, anti-patterns)
- Montai Work Archaeology (factual corrections, additional project details)

**Action Required When Research Complete:**
1. Review voice guide for signature phrases and style patterns
2. Apply authentic voice to all [VOICE] sections per checklist
3. Cross-reference archaeology outputs for factual accuracy
4. Run voice quality checks (no generic AI patterns)
5. Build and preview locally
6. Commit with voice application documentation
7. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Deferred (Tier 3 Case Studies)

📋 **Documented Candidates:**
- Bridging Computational and Experimental Teams (Anthrograph)
- Data Pipeline Architecture (dbt implementation)

**Decision:** Defer until Tier 1-2 complete and user feedback indicates need.

---

## Portfolio Readiness

**Current State:**
- 7 total case studies (2 existing + 5 new scaffolds)
- Demonstrates breadth: product strategy, technical architecture, execution leadership, strategic analysis
- Employer-safe positioning (no consulting business signals)
- Authentic factual basis (Montai Work Archaeology)

**Blocking Item:**
- Voice authenticity (cannot deploy generic AI voice per CLAUDE.md constraint)

**Unblocking Path:**
- ChatGPT Deep Research completion
- Voice overlay application (~1-2 days work)
- Final review and deployment

---

## Recommendation

**Do NOT proceed with writing-plans skill beyond this point.**

**Rationale:**
1. Factual scaffolds complete (all extraction work done)
2. Voice overlay requires Deep Research inputs (not yet available)
3. Premature deployment risks generic AI voice (undermines "decision evidence" brand)

**Next Action:**
- Exit writing-plans skill
- Await Deep Research completion
- Resume with voice overlay using execution-plans skill + checklist
