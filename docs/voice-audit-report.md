# Voice Audit Report - Current Portfolio Content

**Date**: 2026-01-24
**Status**: ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES - Content does not match authentic voice

---

## Executive Summary

Current portfolio content contains **significant voice authenticity issues** and **fabricated metrics** not found in Work Archaeology. All three main content files (About, Resume, Case Studies) require complete rewrites before publication.

**Critical Findings:**
- ❌ Fabricated metrics throughout ($2M+, $75k/yr, 85-90% reductions)
- ❌ Generic AI writing patterns dominate
- ❌ Missing signature vocabulary from Voice Guide
- ❌ Lacks authentic sentence structures
- ❌ No evidence tying claims to actual Montai work

## File-by-File Analysis

### 1. About Page (`content/about.md`)

**Overall Assessment**: ⚠️ Generic origin story template, lacks authentic voice

#### Generic AI Patterns Detected

| Line | Current Text | Issue | Voice Guide Violation |
|------|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| 9 | "I didn't plan to leave academic research" | Generic template opening | No evidence this is how Athan talks |
| 9 | "I loved the rigor" | Vague emotional statement | Missing specifics/data |
| 10 | "somewhere between..." | Meandering narrative | Lacks Athan's directness |
| 15 | "Most data science leaders I meet" | Unverifiable claim | No evidence in source material |
| 21 | "Most people are 2 out of 3" | Generic claim | Lacks Athan's evidence-backed style |
| 33 | "consulting services" | Wrong terminology | Should be "advisory" (employer-safe) |

#### Missing Voice Elements

**Signature phrases (0/30 used):**
- ❌ No "central source of truth"
- ❌ No "data-driven decision-making"
- ❌ No "North Star + guardrails"
- ❌ No "decision-quality" vs "works-in-progress"
- ❌ No "measurable impact" with actual metrics

**Sentence structures:**
- ❌ No em-dash definitions
- ❌ No colon-introduced lists
- ❌ No compound parallel clauses
- ❌ Generic meandering sentences instead

#### Specific Rewrites Needed

1. **Opening paragraph** (lines 7-9): Replace generic origin story with evidence from Work Archaeology PhD section
2. **"What I Bring" section** (lines 17-23): Ground claims in actual Montai projects, use signature vocabulary
3. **Closing links** (line 33): Change "consulting" → "advisory"

### 2. Resume/Decision Portfolio (`content/resume.md`)

**Overall Assessment**: 🚨 CRITICAL - Fabricated metrics throughout

#### Fabricated Content Flagged

| Section | Fabricated Claims | Evidence Status |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| System 1 (lines 23-33) | "$2M+ in compound development", "3 months earlier", "two models" | ❌ NOT IN WORK ARCHAEOLOGY |
| System 2 (lines 37-47) | "4-6 hours to 20-30 minutes", "$75k/year savings", "85-90% reduction" | ❌ NOT IN WORK ARCHAEOLOGY |
| Current Role (lines 69-73) | "~90% cycle time", "$75k/yr compute cost", "$10M+ R&D decisions", "~20% precision" | ❌ NOT IN WORK ARCHAEOLOGY |
| System 3 - PhD (lines 51-59) | Generic description | ⚠️ LACKS SPECIFICS |

#### Generic AI Patterns Detected

| Pattern | Count | Examples |
|---------|-------|----------|
| "I designed..." | 5 | Lines 27, 41, 55, 100, 115 |
| "I built..." | 3 | Lines 72, 84 |
| Vague metrics | 10+ | "$2M+", "~90%", "$75k/yr" (all unverified) |
| Missing attribution | All | No "Work Archaeology sourced from..." |

#### Missing Voice Elements

**Signature phrases (1/30 used):**
- ✅ "North star + guardrails" (line 101) - ONLY ONE!
- ❌ No "central source of truth"
- ❌ No "data-driven decision-making"
- ❌ No "decision-quality" vs "works-in-progress"
- ❌ No "iterative improvement"
- ❌ No "cross-functional"
- ❌ No "end-to-end solution"

**Tone issues:**
- Too achievement-focused ("I designed", "I built")
- Not enough decision-focused ("Decision Context", "Options Considered", "Tradeoffs")
- Missing authentic voice patterns from Voice Guide

#### Required Actions

1. **DELETE Systems 1-2** - Completely fabricated, no evidence in Work Archaeology
2. **REPLACE with actual projects** from Work Archaeology:
   - Compound Nomination Pipeline
   - CIDER Gating Framework
   - Data Quality Framework
   - R Shiny Standardization
   - Learning Agenda Framework
3. **REWRITE Current Role** with verified metrics from Work Archaeology
4. **REWRITE Technical Capabilities** using signature vocabulary

---

### 3. Case Study - Metric Theater (`content/case-studies/preventing-metric-theater-drug-discovery-ml.md`)

**Overall Assessment**: 🚨 CRITICAL - Entirely fabricated, DELETE FILE

#### Fabrication Evidence

| Element | Current Content | Work Archaeology Status |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| Entire premise | "Preventing Metric Theater" | ❌ NO SUCH PROJECT |
| All metrics | "$2M+", "3 months earlier", "two models", etc. | ❌ FABRICATED |
| Timeline | 2026-01-09 | ❌ FUTURE DATE |
| Decision options | Options A/B/C framework | ⚠️ Template structure, no real details |

#### Voice Issues

- Generic AI sentence structures throughout
- No signature phrases from Voice Guide
- Missing Athan's authentic decision-framing style
- Lacks specific stakeholder names/teams from Work Archaeology

#### Required Action

**DELETE THIS FILE** - Replace with actual case study from Work Archaeology:

**Candidate replacements** (from Work Archaeology):
1. **Compound Nomination Pipeline** - Strongest metrics, clear outcomes
2. **CIDER Gating Framework** - Decision framework, stakeholder alignment
3. **Data Quality Framework** - Execution leadership, team impact
4. **Learning Agenda Framework** - Product strategy, risk mitigation
5. **R Shiny Standardization** - Technical architecture, cost optimization

## Priority Actions

### Immediate (Block Publishing)
1. ❌ **DELETE fabricated case studies** (metric-theater, pipeline-latency)
2. ❌ **DELETE fabricated resume systems** (Systems 1-2)
3. ⚠️ **QUARANTINE About page** (rewrite required)

### Phase 3 (Replace Content)
1. ✅ **SELECT 5-7 actual case studies** from Work Archaeology
2. ✅ **WRITE new case studies** using Voice Guide + Work Archaeology facts
3. ✅ **REWRITE Resume** with verified Montai work (2022-2026)
4. ✅ **REWRITE About** with authentic origin story

### Phase 6 (Final Validation)
1. Voice validation checklist on all new content
2. Cross-reference all metrics against Work Archaeology
3. Verify employer-safe positioning maintained

## Risk Assessment

**Publication Risk**: 🚨 **CRITICAL**

**If published as-is:**
- Credibility damage from fabricated metrics
- Ethical issues (claiming work/numbers not in evidence)
- Employer risk (appears to be running consulting business)
- Voice inauthenticity detectable by colleagues/peers

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT PUBLISH** until complete rewrite using Work Archaeology + Voice Guide.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 2**: Test voice on About page sample (Task 3)
2. **Begin Phase 3**: Select case studies from Work Archaeology
3. **Execute Phase 3**: Write first authentic case study as pilot
4. **Validate pilot**: Review voice match before scaling to remaining content
5. **Complete rewrite**: All content must use Work Archaeology facts + Voice Guide patterns
