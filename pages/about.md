# **About Me**

Hi, I am Athan :wave:<br>
<br>
As a scientist by training and analyst by practice, I am passionate about seeking data-driven insights in the pursuit of optimizing human health. <br>
<br>
I have extensive hands-on expertise with a wide range of high dimensional healthcare data, including: **clinical trials**, **bioinformatics** (microarray, NGS), **biomedical** (clinical & microscopic imaging data), **athletic performance** - making me a unique asset for health data science teams. <br>
<br>
My experience and tech toolkit are constantly growing - see below for more about me, or check out my projects page for some of the personal projects I've enjoyed working on. Enjoy! <br>
