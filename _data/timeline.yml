- title: Data Scientist, Replica Analytics
  from: 2019
  to: 2020
  description: As the first data scientist at Replica, I was charged with developing end-to-end analysis
               programs in R and Python for data synthesis and privacy assurance on hospital discharge
               and clinical trials data. In my role, I spearheaded projects requiring the intake,
               processing, cleaning, and verifying the integrity of multi-million row datasets
               for subsequent implementation of proprietary machine learning approaches. As a fully
               remote employee, I was able to become very familiar operating in an AWS environment to
               ensure delivery of projects, documented both as printable documents and Shiny web apps.

- title: Founding Partner & Chief Analytics Officer, ARCHITECHEALTH
  from: 2018
  to: 2019
  description: ARCHITECHEALTH was a life sciences consultancy which supported and advised a range
               of clients from early-stage biotech startups to Johnson & Johnson and IBM. As CAO,
               I was responsible for quantitative analyses of our consulting engagements which
               involved the synthesis of datasets sourced from publicly available and client data.

- title: Ph.D. Candidate, McMaster University
  from: 2017
  to: present
  description: Wrapping up in the summer, my doctoral work is focused on the discovery of novel traits
               of skeletal muscle in patients with type 1 diabetes. My focus has been on complementing
               data-mining approaches of transcriptomic data with in-house laboratory-derived results.
               I have deep expertise in the querying, filtering, analysis and interpretations of many
               'omic' data types including microarray and next-gen sequencing data in R.
