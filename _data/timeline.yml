  description:

As the first data scientist at Replica, I was charged with developing end-to-end analysis programs
in **R** and **Python** for data synthesis and privacy assurance on hospital discharge
and clinical trials data. In my role, I spearheaded projects requiring the intake,
processing, cleaning, and verifying the integrity of large multi-million row datasets
for subsequent implementation of proprietary **machine learning** techniques. As a fully
remote employee, I was able to become very familiar operating in an **AWS** environment to
ensure end-to-end delivery of projects were completed and documented for internal and external
clientele.
